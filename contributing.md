# Code style
- All the code written must be compliant with c++17 in order to maintain coherence.
- Try to avoid platform-specific code by all means.
- All the `protected` members of a class must start with an underscore.
- All files in lower case and snake_case.
- All variable names in camelCase.
- Maintain the directory structure so that navigation, debugging and building the project is easier.
