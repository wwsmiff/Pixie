# Code style
- All the code written must be compliant with c++20 in order to maintain coherence.
- Try to avoid platform-specific code by all means.
- All files in lower case and snake_case.
- All common variable and function names in camelCase.
- All private/protected variables of classes must be prefixed with an `m`.
- Maintain the directory structure so that navigation, debugging and building the project is easier.
- Use the [Allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style) indentation style.
